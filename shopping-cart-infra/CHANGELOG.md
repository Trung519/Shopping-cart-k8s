# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `argocd/applications/data-layer.yaml` — ArgoCD Application for data-layer (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis); previously required manual `kubectl apply`
- `data-layer/secrets/redis-cart-apps-externalsecret.yaml` — sync redis-cart password into `shopping-cart-apps/redis-cart-secret` for basket-service
- `data-layer/secrets/redis-orders-cache-apps-externalsecret.yaml` — sync redis-orders-cache password into `shopping-cart-apps/redis-orders-cache-secret`
- `data-layer/secrets/postgres-orders-apps-externalsecret.yaml` — sync postgres/orders creds into `shopping-cart-apps/order-service-secrets` (all env keys)
- `data-layer/secrets/postgres-products-apps-externalsecret.yaml` — sync postgres/products creds into `shopping-cart-apps/product-catalog-secrets` (all env keys)

### Fixed
- `data-layer/secrets/postgres-orders-apps-externalsecret.yaml`: add `SPRING_RABBITMQ_USERNAME`/`SPRING_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` to ESO template — supplies Vault-managed RabbitMQ credentials to Spring AMQP auto-config; host/port/vhost are set via the companion `shopping-cart-order` ConfigMap change (`SPRING_RABBITMQ_HOST/PORT/VIRTUAL_HOST`)
- `argocd/config/argocd-cm.yaml`: add ExternalSecret custom Lua health check so ArgoCD waits for `SecretSynced` before advancing past wave 0 — prevents StatefulSets from starting before secrets exist
- `data-layer/secrets/*.yaml` (12 files): add `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "0"` — ExternalSecrets deploy in wave 0 and must reach Healthy before wave 1 begins
- `data-layer/redis/*/statefulset.yaml`, `data-layer/rabbitmq/statefulset.yaml`, `data-layer/postgresql/*/statefulset.yaml` (6 files): add `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "1"` — StatefulSets deploy after ExternalSecrets are synced, eliminating the `CHANGE_ME` / `CreateContainerConfigError` race condition on fresh provision
- `argocd/applications/order-service.yaml`, `argocd/applications/product-catalog.yaml`: add `SPRING_JPA_HIBERNATE_DDL_AUTO=create` kustomize ConfigMap patch — Hibernate recreates the schema on each sandbox provision instead of failing `validate` on empty or stale tables
- `data-layer/secrets/*.yaml`: update `apiVersion` from `external-secrets.io/v1beta1` to `external-secrets.io/v1` — ESO 0.9.20 on k3s serves `v1`; `v1beta1` was not available, causing ArgoCD sync failures for `data-layer` and `product-catalog`
- RabbitMQ `configmap.yaml`: add `loopback_users.guest = false` — guest user was restricted to localhost by default, causing "Connection refused" from cross-namespace pods
- RabbitMQ `statefulset.yaml`: reduce resource requests 500m/1Gi → 200m/512Mi to fit t3.medium with co-located services; keep limits at 1000m/1Gi
- Scale RabbitMQ from 3 replicas to 1 to reduce memory pressure on t3.medium (3×1Gi requests exhausted available RAM)
- `data-layer/rabbitmq/service.yaml`: change `rabbitmq-management` from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP` — LoadBalancer stays `Progressing` on k3s (no cloud LB), blocking ArgoCD wave 1 (StatefulSets) from deploying; ClusterIP resolves immediately as Healthy (`dfc949d` — PR #27)
- `data-layer/secrets/*.yaml`: use single-line connection strings — remove backslash-newline continuations in double-quoted YAML scalars to avoid whitespace/backslash ambiguity across tooling (`ad0817d` — PR #26)
